# Explanation of the Bass Diffusion Model Script
This R script uses the Bass Diffusion Model, a popular mathematical model for forecasting the adoption of new products or innovations. Here's a detailed explanation of the script:

1. Setup
Set Random Seed: Ensures reproducibility by using set.seed(1).
Load Sales Data: The dataset sales_data.csv is read into R, containing sales figures over time.

2. Data Preparation
Cumulative Sales: Calculates the cumulative sales (cumsales) to track the total adoption over time.
Lagged Variables: Creates lagged cumulative sales (cumsales_1) and lagged squared cumulative sales (cumsales2_1) for use as independent variables in the regression model.

3. Model Building
Bass Diffusion Regression: Fits a linear regression model (lm()) to predict sales based on cumulative sales and lagged cumulative squared sales:
Formula: sales ~ cumsales_1 + cumsales2_1.

4. Parameter Estimation
 - Extract Model Coefficients:
a: Intercept.
b: Coefficient for cumsales_1.
c: Coefficient for cumsales2_1.
 - Calculate Parameters:
N: Total market size (maximum adopters).
p: Coefficient of innovation (early adopters).
q: Coefficient of imitation (influenced by others).
 
5. Forecasting
 - Sales Forecast:
Initializes a sequence of 50 time periods.

 - Iteratively calculates:
Predicted sales (psales).
Predicted cumulative sales (pcumsales).
 
 - Outputs Forecast Data:
psales: Predicted sales for each period.
pcumsales: Predicted cumulative sales for each period.
 
6. Save Results
Exports Results:
 - cumulative_sales_data.csv: Processed sales data with cumulative calculations.
 - sales_forecasts.csv: Predicted sales and cumulative sales data.
